## About
This is a nonogram tour of Minneapolis' [Grand Rounds Scenic Byway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Rounds_National_Scenic_Byway), a submission for [Jason's C++ Best Practices Game Jam](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/game_jam/blob/main/README.md).  At least, that's what it's supposed to be, except time constraints mean it shows very little of the Grand Rounds at the moment.

## How To Play
To learn how to play nonograms in general, see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zisu0Qf4TAI&list=PLH_elo2OIwaAYMF8CAfDnlKcVyyB5UITk]
To play this implementation of the game specifically: click with the left mouse button to fill a cell (color it black).  Click with the right button to clear a cell (color it white).  Click with the middle button to "mark" a cell.  Keyboard controls are presently not supported.

## Requirements
You'll need a terminal with mouse support, ideally 24-bit color support, and at least enough font support to display a "▄" character.  I've only tested on Windows, with Windows Terminal, which should work out of the box.
